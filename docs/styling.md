# Styling

The styling for the project is done with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

### General

Base styling files that are imported into almost all other styling files are located in the [scss/](../client/src/scss)-folder. The folder contains:
- [Base](../client/src/scss/_base.scss)
⋅⋅⋅Universal styling for our feedbacker app
- [Colors](../client/src/scss/_colors.scss)
⋅⋅⋅Our color palette, for example `$palette-accent`
- [Functions](../client/src/scss/_functions.scss)
⋅⋅⋅For scss function
- [Mixins](../client/src/scss/_mixins.scss)
⋅⋅⋅For scss mixins
- [Typography](../client/src/scss/_typography.scss)
⋅⋅⋅The typography for the feedbacker app
- [Variables](../client/src/scss/_variables.scss)
⋅⋅⋅All the base variables for the feedbacker app, for example `$baseline` and `$spacer`


All the important ones can be imported as one from the [compulsory](../client/src/scss/_compulsory.scss) file.
